# FriendFinder

## Overview
Friend Finder is an app that helps users find a friend based on similarities they share. It is similar to Tinder and Bumble.


## Using the App
Friend Finder operates using Express for node.js. The app provides the user with a survey with ten questions. Each question relates to personality and choices the user makes in real-life situations. Each question contains five options: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). Once the survey is filled out and submitted, the app calcuates the compatibility of that user. It compares the current user's results with all of the results from other users in the system. A modal will pop up displaying the "Best Match" for that user.


 ## Why is it useful?
 Friend Finder is useful for those who would like to discover people of similar personality traits. This app attracts those who are bored at home, new in town or do not have any friends locally. It can also be useful for someone who is more comfortable communicating online. 


## Getting Started
Users may get started by first clicking on the deployed link below. By clicking on the "Go to Survey" button, the user will be transferred to the survey page. Each question will contain a drop down bar with answer choices. Once "submit" is clicked, the user's "Best Match" will show up instantly.
